      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        At Suno Audiobook, we deeply value the trust you place in us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
        use, store, and protect your information when you access or use our website and digital services.

        <h3>From the Creator</h3>
        <p>
          Suno Audiobook was not born in a studio or a big company office. It was born from late nights, silence,
          imagination, and a deep love for stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the stories you hear here are written, adapted, or creatively shaped by us.
          To bring these stories to life, we sometimes use AI-generated voice technology.
          Not because we want to replace humans, but because we do not yet have the luxury of studios,
          actors, or a large production team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using AI voice is not about shortcuts. It is about survival. It is about continuing to create
          when the world tells you to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind every audio is a real human mind that imagined, wrote, edited, and dreamed.
          Technology is only a tool. The soul of every story is still human.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are here, listening or reading this, you are already part of this journey.
          Thank you for being here.
